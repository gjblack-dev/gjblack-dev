# 👋 Hey there, I'm Gabriel J. Black

🎓 I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at the University of West Florida, passionate about building systems from the ground up — whether it's custom CPUs on an FPGA, real-time audio processors in C++, or socket-based web servers.

## 💻 What I Do
- 👾 Low-level systems programming (C++, VHDL, Python)
- 🔌 Embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino, custom microcontroller design)
- 🎛️ Digital and analog audio projects (PortAudio, buffer pedals, DSP)
- 🧠 CPU design, instruction decoding, App Development, Assembly
- 🌐 Network programming (multithreaded TCP servers in C++)

## 🔧 Projects
Here are a few of the things I’ve built (or am actively building):
- **🖥️ 16-bit Microcontroller on FPGA** – Fully custom instruction set, UART loader, instruction decoder
- **🌐 TCP Web Server** – C++ server using raw sockets to handle HTTP GET requests
- **🎸 Buffer Guitar Pedal** – TL072-based analog pedal for signal integrity and tone preservation
- **📂 Custom Shell Implementation** – A Unix-like shell in C++ with process control, I/O redirection, and background execution
- **⚡ Multi-Threaded Collatz Generator** – Parallelized computation of Collatz stopping times with mutex-based synchronization and performance analysis
- **🚗 Autonomous Car** – AVR assembly–programmed microcontroller car with reflectance sensors for line following and PWM motor control:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **📡 Wireless IR Sensor Mail Checker** – ESP32-based TCP server with IR detection and battery monitoring, paired with a C# Windows Forms client app:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **🕹️ App-Controlled Car** – Arduino Mega + C# Windows Forms app for remote-controlled vehicle with IR sensors and multi-motor control:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Below you can find the code for some of the projects!
