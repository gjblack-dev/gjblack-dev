# 👋 Hey there, I'm Gabriel J. Black

🎓 I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at the University of West Florida, passionate about building systems from the ground up — whether it's custom CPUs on an FPGA, real-time audio processors in C++, or socket-based web servers.

## 💻 What I Do
- 👾 Low-level systems programming (C++, VHDL, Python)
- 🔌 Embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino, custom microcontroller design)
- 🎛️ Digital and analog audio projects (PortAudio, buffer pedals, DSP)
- 🧠 CPU design, UART loaders, instruction decoding, pipelining
- 🌐 Network programming (multithreaded TCP servers in C++)

## 🔧 Projects
Here are a few of the things I’ve built (or am actively building):
- **🖥️ 16-bit Microcontroller on FPGA** – Fully custom instruction set, UART loader, instruction decoder
- **🌐 TCP Web Server** – C++ server using raw sockets to handle HTTP GET requests
- **🎸 Buffer Guitar Pedal** – TL072-based analog pedal for signal integrity and tone preservation


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages**: C++, VHDL, Python, MATLAB, C  
**Tools**: Quartus Prime, ModelSim, Git, PortAudio, Multisim  
**Hardware**: DE1-SoC FPGA, ESP32, Arduino, Logic Analyzers  
**Concepts**: Digital logic design, pipelining, embedded systems, audio signal processing, UART, socket programming
