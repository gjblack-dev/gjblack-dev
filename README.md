# 👋 Hey there, I'm Gabriel J. Black

🎓 I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at the University of West Florida, passionate about building systems from the ground up — whether it's custom CPUs on an FPGA, real-time audio processors in C++, or socket-based web servers.

## 💻 What I Do
- 👾 **Low-Level Systems Programming** – C++, VHDL, Python, with a focus on performance, concurrency, and resource management  
- 🔌 **Embedded Systems & Hardware Integration** – ESP32, Arduino, and fully custom 16-bit microcontroller/CPU design in VHDL with UART loaders and instruction decoders  
- 🎛️ **Audio Engineering & DSP** – Digital/analog guitar pedals (buffer, parametric EQ), real-time audio processing with PortAudio, and DSP experimentation  
- 🧠 **Computer Architecture & Assembly** – Custom instruction sets, instruction decoding, pipeline-style execution, and assembly-level optimization (AVR, x86 concepts)  
- 🌐 **Networking & Distributed Systems** – Multithreaded TCP servers/clients in C++, HTTP implementations, and networked embedded applications (ESP32 + C# frontends)  
- 📱 **Application Development** – C# Windows Forms apps for embedded control, data visualization, and hardware-software integration projects  

## 🔧 Projects
Here are a few of the things I’ve built (or am actively building):
- **🖥️ 16-bit Microcontroller on FPGA** – Fully custom instruction set, UART loader, instruction decoder
- **🌐 TCP Web Server** – C++ server using raw sockets to handle HTTP GET requests
- **🎸 Buffer Guitar Pedal** – TL072-based analog pedal for signal integrity and tone preservation
- **📂 Custom Shell Implementation** – A Unix-like shell in C++ with process control, I/O redirection, and background execution
- **⚡ Multi-Threaded Collatz Generator** – Parallelized computation of Collatz stopping times with mutex-based synchronization and performance analysis
- **🚗 Autonomous Car** – AVR assembly–programmed microcontroller car with reflectance sensors for line following and PWM motor control
- **📡 Wireless IR Sensor Mail Checker** – ESP32-based TCP server with IR detection and battery monitoring, paired with a C# Windows Forms client app
- **🕹️ App-Controlled Car** – Arduino Mega + C# Windows Forms app for remote-controlled vehicle with IR sensors and multi-motor control
